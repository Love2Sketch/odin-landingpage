# odin-landingpage
My landing page project for TOP

In this project I learned a lot about using flexbox and at the end trimming down my CSS by using more element selectors and grouping selectors. I also tried out indenting my CSS and I think it's much easier to read now.

I changed pretty much all the fonts and colors, but kept the basic idea of The Odin Project's Assignment's layout. I'm happy with how it turned out!
